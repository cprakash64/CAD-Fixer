/**
 * CRU11, CRU12: WHAT A REPAIR UNDO LOOKS LIKE FROM OUTSIDE THE WORKER.
 *
 * The contract suite proves the resident document holds the original mesh OBJECT
 * again. Two consequences of that are only observable here, and both are things
 * a user would eventually notice:
 *
 *   - the GPU. `SharedPartGeometry` reference-counts by position-array identity,
 *     so a document that is sharing again while the page holds two equal arrays
 *     uploads a second geometry for a picture it is already drawing;
 *   - the exported file. 3MF encodes structural sharing directly — parts that
 *     share a mesh become one `<object>` resource referenced twice — so an undo
 *     that restored bytes but lost identity would silently double the resources
 *     in every 3MF exported afterwards.
 *
 * WHY THE HARNESS. No shipped importer can produce two parts that SHARE one
 * `CanonicalMesh`, which is exactly the document the defect needed.
