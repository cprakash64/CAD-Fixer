/**
 * The worker's registry of authoritative geometry.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Stage 1 transferred the canonical mesh to the main thread as
 * soon as it was parsed, which made the UI the owner of the geometry. Every
 * later operation then had to send it back: export structured-cloned ~96 MiB
 * into the worker for a 2M-triangle model, and diagnostics, repair, booleans and
 * hollowing would each have paid the same toll. Ownership now stays where the
 * work happens.
 *
 * The main thread holds a `DocumentHandle` — an id and a revision — plus render
 * snapshots. It never holds the authoritative document.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED IN STAGE 4A-2A. The unit of authority is a `GeometryDocument`
 * rather than a single `CanonicalMesh`. A one-part STL document behaves exactly
 * as the single mesh did; a multi-part document is the same transaction with
 * more parts inside it. Nothing about identity, revisions or staleness changed,
 * which was the point: see docs/adr/0013.
 *
 * ONE REVISION PER DOCUMENT, and it lives here rather than on the document
 * object. A `revision` field inside `GeometryDocument` would be a second
 * authority that could disagree with this one, and every staleness guard in the
 * product is built on there being exactly one.
 *
 * REVISIONS EXIST TO MAKE STALE OPERATIONS FAIL LOUDLY. An operation dispatched
 * against revision 3 must not silently apply to revision 4 after the document
 * has been replaced underneath it. Every geometry operation names the revision
 * it expects, and a mismatch is an error rather than a surprise. A change to ANY
 * part consumes the document's revision, so a result computed for part A is
 * invalidated by an edit to part B. That is deliberate over-invalidation: an
 * over-invalidated result is recomputed, whereas an under-invalidated one is
 * applied to geometry it was not built from.
 *
 * This module is deliberately platform-free: no DOM, no worker globals. It is
 * the worker's state, but it is testable as a plain object.
