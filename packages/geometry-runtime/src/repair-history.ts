/**
 * WORKER-RESIDENT UNDO HISTORY.
 *
 * Stage 3B-1A produced an inverse patch for every accepted repair but had
 * nowhere to keep it. This is that place, and it is deliberately in the worker
 * rather than in React state: undo must restore AUTHORITATIVE geometry, and the
 * main thread does not hold any. A React-held copy of the pre-repair mesh would
 * make the UI a second owner of the user's data and would defeat the resident
 * design entirely — see docs/adr/0008.
 *
 * WHAT IS RETAINED, and what is not. Exactly ONE undoable record per model: the
 * most recent change. A deeper stack would retain a mesh per step for the
 * lifetime of the session. Superseded records survive as DESCRIPTORS — what was
 * applied, and between which revisions — with their retained mesh released, so
 * the trail stays readable without holding geometry for it.
 *
 * THE INVERSE IS THE ONLY THING HERE THAT HOLDS GEOMETRY, and releasing a record
 * releases it. Every path that ends a record's usefulness — undone, superseded,
 * document released, store released, evicted by the descriptor cap — goes
 * through `release` or deletes the record outright, so there is exactly one
 * place a retained mesh can be dropped and no way to reach a record whose
 * inverse is gone.
 *
 * REDO IS NOT IMPLEMENTED. Undoing retains no forward patch, and nothing here
 * pretends otherwise. See docs/adr/0011.
 *
 * ONE STACK FOR EVERY DOCUMENT MUTATION — Stage 4B-1B2. A hole fill is recorded
 * here too, and reversed by the same `repair/undo` transaction. A second,
 * hole-specific history would be a second answer to "what does Undo do next",
 * and the two would eventually disagree about which change is the most recent
 * one. Since Stage 4B-1C nothing about the record varies with the kind either:
 * both retain the mesh the part held and both are reversed by putting it back,
 * so the guards, the supersession rule, the one-per-document cap and the
 * descriptor trail are shared along with the reversal itself.
 */

/**
 * WHAT KIND of change a record describes.
 *
 * Reported so the interface can say what Undo would reverse. It no longer
 * selects a reconstruction — since Stage 4B-1C both kinds are reversed the same
 * way — but a repair and a fill are still different things to a user, and a
 * result that could not name which one had happened would be guessing.

/**
 * How a recorded change is reversed: BY PUTTING THE EXACT PREVIOUS MESH BACK.
 *
 * ONE MECHANISM FOR BOTH KINDS — Stage 4B-1C. It was two, and the second was
 * wrong. A conservative repair used to retain a PATCH of the triangles it
 * removed and rebuild the previous mesh from it, which reproduced geometry the
 * user would recognise and a document they did not have:
 *
 *   - the rebuild was NON-INDEXED, nine coordinates per face, so an indexed OBJ
 *     or 3MF import came back as triangle soup — a different vertex count, a
 *     different index buffer, different bytes, and a different exported file
 *     from then on. Measured on a four-vertex indexed tetrahedron: it returned
 *     with fifteen vertices;
 *   - it was a NEW object, so a document whose parts SHARED one `CanonicalMesh`
 *     came back holding two byte-equal ones, permanently, along with two GPU
 *     geometries and two 3MF object resources.
 *
 * Neither showed up in a triangle count, and neither showed up in the suite that
 * existed, because STL is already soup and STL was the only importable format
 * when the patch was written. Structural sharing and indexing are both part of
 * the document contract (ADR 0014), so restoring bytes is not restoring the
 * document — and for an indexed source the patch did not even restore the bytes.
 *
 * RETAINING AN IMMUTABLE MESH IS O(1). Nothing is copied, compared or defended
 * against mutation: the record holds the object the part held. The patch design
 * existed to avoid COPYING the previous model on every undo step; a REFERENCE
 * copies nothing, and where a sibling still holds the mesh it costs a pointer.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS, stated rather than hidden. When the mesh is still referenced by
 * a sibling the reference is free. When the changed part was its only owner, the
 * record keeps that mesh alive until it is undone, superseded, evicted or its
 * document released — one part's geometry per document, bounded by the
 * one-undoable-change rule, and `retainedBytes` reports it.
 *
 * IT IS WORKER-RESIDENT AND MUST STAY SO. This type is not part of the wire
 * protocol and a boundary test asserts it never becomes part of one. The page
 * receives a record id; the mesh never leaves the worker that owns it.
