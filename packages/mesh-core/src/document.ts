 * The canonical multi-part geometry document.

 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Until Stage 4A-2A the authoritative unit of geometry was one
 * `CanonicalMesh`. That was adequate while STL was the only format, because an
 * STL file describes exactly one triangle soup. OBJ and 3MF do not: an OBJ `o`
 * record and a 3MF `<build><item>` each declare a separate thing, and a 3MF
 * component may place the SAME geometry twice. A single-mesh authority can only
 * represent those by flattening, which destroys per-item transforms and object
 * identity — see docs/adr/0013 for why that was rejected.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. Not a scene graph. There are no cameras, no lights, no
 * animation, no hierarchy and no B-rep. The only concepts here are the ones the
 * qualified research showed OBJ, 3MF, conversion and future splitting need.
 *
 * WHERE IDENTITY AND REVISION LIVE. Deliberately NOT here. A document object
 * carrying its own `revision` field would be a second revision authority beside
 * the resident store's, and the two could disagree. The store owns identity and
 * the single monotonic revision; this type owns content only.

 *
 * TWELVE, NOT SIXTEEN. The bottom row of an affine 3D transform is always
 * `0 0 0 1`; storing it invites a caller to write something else there and
 * produce a projective transform the rest of the product cannot honour. This is
 * also the shape 3MF states its `transform` attribute in, so an import neither
 * reorders nor pads.
 *
 * FLOAT64, NOT FLOAT32. Transforms are read from text and written back to text.
 * The research measured a Float32 narrowing as introducing an error the source
 * never had, and a `toFixed(6)` writer as losing 51,649 of 99,959 values. A
 * plain JS number tuple IS Float64, so the contract is met by construction
