/**
 * THE WHOLE-DOCUMENT BINARY STL WRITER.
 *
 * DIFFERENT FROM `stl/stl-writer.ts`, and deliberately so. That writer takes
 * ONE `CanonicalMesh` and is what the active-part quick export uses. This one
 * takes a whole `ExportDocumentSnapshot` and flattens every part into a single
 * triangle stream, because that is what "convert this document to STL" has to
 * mean: STL has one implicit object and no way to say otherwise.
 *
 * WHAT STL CANNOT CARRY, and is therefore never pretended:
 *
 *   - PARTS. Everything becomes one soup. A document's part structure is gone,
 *     which is a structural loss and is recorded as one.
 *   - TRANSFORMS. A placement survives only by being applied to coordinates.
 *   - UNITS. The format has no field at all, so a document with a known unit
 *     loses the label. The coordinates are NOT rescaled to compensate.
 *   - NAMES, GROUPS, MATERIAL REFERENCES, SHARED INSTANCES. All flattened away.
 *
 * BINARY, NOT ASCII. The active-part exporter offers both because a user may
 * want to read the file; a whole-document conversion of a multi-part model is
 * the large case, and ASCII is roughly five times the size for the same
 * geometry — large enough that the self-round-trip policy in `stl-writer.ts`
 * starts refusing files binary would write happily. One encoding also makes the
 * output size EXACTLY predictable, which is what lets this refuse an impossible
 * conversion before allocating anything.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MUTATES THE SNAPSHOT. Flattening is a property of the output; it
 * happens into the output buffer and into nothing else. There is no flattened
 * `CanonicalMesh` anywhere, authoritative or otherwise.
