/**
 * THE PRODUCTION 3MF WRITER.
 *
 * WHAT 3MF CARRIES THAT OBJ CANNOT, and this writer therefore does not lose:
 *
 *   - THE UNIT, written as the document's own token. Coordinates are never
 *     rescaled: the unit says what the numbers mean, not what they are.
 *   - THE PLACEMENTS, as `<item transform>` in Float64 decimal. Nothing is
 *     baked into a vertex.
 *   - THE SHARING. One distinct mesh becomes ONE `<object>`, and every part
 *     that uses it becomes a `<build><item>` pointing at that object. A
 *     thousand placements of one mesh serialise its geometry once. The research
 *     prototype wrote one object per part; production does not, because
 *     flattening sharing on write would turn a two-megabyte document into a
 *     two-gigabyte file for no reason.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT WRITE: any property resource, and therefore any `pid`. See
 * the object element below — a reference to a resource that does not exist is
 * not a preserved material, it is a malformed file.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT: reconstructing the nested component graph an
 * imported file may have had. A `GeometryDocument` holds leaf placements and
 * mesh identity; the hierarchy above them is not retained, and inventing a
 * plausible one would be describing a structure the user never wrote. Output is
 * therefore canonical — mesh objects plus build items — and reads back as the
 * same document.
 *
 * ARCHIVE PATHS ARE FIXED. No entry path is derived from a document name, a
 * part name, a material reference or anything else that came from a file.
