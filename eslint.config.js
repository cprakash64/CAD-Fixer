 * Beyond the usual correctness rules, this file mechanically enforces two
 * project invariants that would otherwise rely on reviewer memory:
 *
 * 1. NETWORK SILENCE — the browser's network APIs are banned outright. CAD
 *    Fixer must not transmit anything, and the cheapest way to keep that true
 *    is to make an accidental `fetch` fail CI. Lifting this requires an ADR.
 * 2. LAYER SEPARATION — geometry packages may not import UI libraries, and no
 *    package may reach into the application.
