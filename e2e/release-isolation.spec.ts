/**
 * BQ25, BQ57 — WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A HOST FORGETS THE ISOLATION HEADERS.
 *
 * This is the most likely production misconfiguration there is, and it is
 * dangerous precisely because it does not look like a failure. Without COOP and
 * COEP the browser withholds `SharedArrayBuffer`; conservative repair's Cancel
 * depends on it, because a flag a worker can read mid-loop is the only way to
 * interrupt a synchronous pass. A build that shrugged and carried on would offer
 * a Cancel control that cannot cancel — worse than offering none.
 *
 * SERVED WITHOUT THE HEADERS, ON PURPOSE. `scripts/release-server.mjs
 * --no-isolation` serves the same production build the rest of the suite uses,
 * minus the three headers, so this is the real browser reaching the real
 * decision rather than a mocked capability.

/**
 * ONE PORT PER PLAYWRIGHT WORKER, and this is a correctness requirement rather
 * than tidiness. `beforeAll` runs once per worker process, so a single fixed port
 * meant four workers racing to bind it: one won and the other three tested
 * against a server that had failed to start. Deriving the port from the worker
 * index gives each its own, so the file is safe under the suite's default
 * parallelism.
