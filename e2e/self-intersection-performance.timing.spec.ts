/**
 * EXPLICIT-BAND PERFORMANCE, measured in real Chromium against the shipped
 * build. Serial project, because a timing measurement taken while three other
 * browsers compete for cores measures the machine.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT SEPARABLE FROM THE PAGE. The controller's phases are
 * observable as UI transitions: the click, the moment the worker reports it has
 * started (which is everything up to and including WASM instantiation and the
 * worker-to-worker geometry transfer), and the terminal result. The kernel's own
 * internal split — broadphase against narrowphase — is NOT observable from the
 * page, and is deliberately not guessed at here. It was measured directly during
 * qualification and is recorded in ADR 0012.
 *
 * IMPORT IS EXCLUDED. It is measured separately and reported separately; folding
 * it into the diagnostic would attribute parsing cost to the check.
