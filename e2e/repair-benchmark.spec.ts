/**
 * Real browser timings for the conservative repair workflow, recorded rather
 * than asserted.
 *
 * WHY SEPARATE FROM `browser-benchmark.spec.ts`. That one measures the path a
 * user takes to SEE their model. This one measures the path they take to CHANGE
 * it, which has a different shape: a plan, a candidate that doubles resident
 * geometry, a preview swap that must not cost a GPU upload, a commit, and the
 * re-analysis that follows it.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT A PERFORMANCE GATE. There is one assertion per run and it is
 * a correctness one: the repair actually completed. Turning wall-clock numbers
 * into CI thresholds on shared hardware produces flaky builds and teaches people
 * to ignore failures. The numbers are printed for
 * `docs/PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md` and reviewed by a person.
 *
 * Skipped unless `CADFIXER_BROWSER_BENCH=1`, because it is slow and belongs to a
 * deliberate measuring session rather than to every end-to-end run.
