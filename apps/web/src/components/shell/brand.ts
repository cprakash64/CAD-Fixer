 * THE PRODUCT'S IDENTITY, IN ONE PLACE.
 *
 * The display name is Pybrix (BRAND-01). Package names, test ids, CSS classes,
 * worker names, environment variables and deployment paths keep their legacy
 * `cadfixer` / `cad-fixer` spelling on purpose — they are identifiers, not
 * identity, and renaming them is an infrastructure migration of its own.
 *
 * The header, Help and the status bar read these constants so they cannot say
 * three different things. Imported artwork is fingerprinted by Vite into
 * `/assets/`: same-origin, immutable, within `img-src 'self'`.
