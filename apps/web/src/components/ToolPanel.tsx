/**
 * The left tool panel: the current workspace's controls.
 *
 * THE REPAIR PANELS ARE HIDDEN, NEVER UNMOUNTED, outside the Repair workspace.
 * Their hooks start the automatic analysis on import, track running worker
 * operations and release candidates when they unmount. Unmounting them on a
 * tab switch would cancel an analysis or discard a validated repair as a side
 * effect of looking at a different workspace. `hidden` takes them out of
 * layout and out of the accessibility tree and ends nothing.
 *
 * The Convert, Split & Connect and Surface Texture workspaces are hidden rather
 * than unmounted for the same reason.
 *
 * WITH NO MODEL OPEN every workspace still opens, and a compact empty state at
 * the top of the body says what it does and offers Open; the commands inside
 * keep their own guards.
 *
 * The footer is the activity log. It stays visible in every workspace because
 * it is where every workflow reports what it did.
