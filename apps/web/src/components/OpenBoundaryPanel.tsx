/**
 * THE OPEN-BOUNDARY WORKFLOW.
 *
 * PRESENTATION AND DISPATCH ONLY. Every sentence comes from
 * `hole-fill-presentation.ts`, every decision from the store, and no geometry
 * comes here at all — the page holds a handle, some counts, and two disposable
 * render buffers it hands straight to the viewport.
 *
 * THIS COMPONENT CANNOT FILL ANYTHING. `Apply fill` calls a hook that calls the
 * worker, and the worker re-checks the candidate's existence, its document, its
 * part, its opening, its lifecycle state and the revision before it swaps a
 * single reference. A defect here can show a wrong label; it cannot change
 * geometry.
 *
 * WHAT THE SCREEN IS FOR, in this order: which openings this part has, which of
 * them CAD Fixer can close and which it will not and why, what a proposed fill
 * looks like, and what filling one does NOT establish. Making the model look
 * closed is not one of the goals — a boundary loop may be exactly what the user
 * modelled.
 *
 * THE DISPLAY INDEX IS A LABEL, NOT AN IDENTITY. A row reads "Opening 3" because
 * it is third in a deterministic order; every request carries the
 * `boundaryLoopId` the worker produced from the geometry it holds. The two can
 * never be confused, because the index is never sent anywhere.

   * gone by the time the operation settles, and the browser's answer to focus on
   * a removed element is to drop it on the document body — losing the user's
   * place on the page entirely, with no indication of what happened. The live
