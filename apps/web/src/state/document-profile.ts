/**
 * THE SCALAR SUMMARY A CONVERSION REPORT IS JUDGED FROM.
 *
 * Built from part descriptors the page already holds, so it costs a walk over a
 * few hundred scalars and touches no geometry — a thousand-part document is a
 * thousand small objects, not a thousand meshes.
 *
 * WHY IT IS DERIVED HERE RATHER THAN FETCHED FROM THE WORKER. A report fetched
 * once is a report that can go stale: the user opens Export, a repair lands, the
 * document moves to revision N+1, and the dialog is now describing geometry that
 * is no longer there. Deriving it from current state makes the report a pure
 * function of the model — when the model changes, React re-renders and the
 * report is recomputed, with no window in which a stale one could authorise an
 * export. See ADR 0017.
 *
 * THE WORKER REMAINS THE AUTHORITY ON WHAT IS WRITTEN. This decides what the
 * user is TOLD; the export snapshot is built from the real document, and the
 * 3MF writer still refuses a unit-less document whatever this said.
