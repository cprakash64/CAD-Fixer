/**
 * THE USER-FACING HOLE-FILL WORKFLOW — Stage 4B-1B2.
 *
 * Three operations sit on top of the Stage 4B-1B1 engine, and between them they
 * are everything that turns a validated candidate into something a person can
 * see and choose:
 *
 *   - `holefill/boundary-preview` draws ONE selected opening;
 *   - `holefill/patch-preview` draws the patch of ONE stored candidate;
 *   - `holefill/commit` applies ONE stored candidate.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, and must never be. No triangulation, no planarity test, no
 * broadphase, no narrowphase, no engine import of any kind. Every geometric
 * decision was made when the candidate was built, in the disposable worker, and
 * re-deriving any of it here would mean committing something other than what
 * the user previewed. This module reads a mesh the store already holds and
 * swaps a reference.
 *
 * THE TWO PREVIEWS ARE RENDER SNAPSHOTS, in exactly the sense ADR 0008 uses the
 * word: disposable display copies that no operation accepts back. Neither can
 * become authoritative, be exported, be analysed, or be turned into a candidate
 * — not because a rule says so, but because no function in the protocol takes
 * one.
 *
 * APPLY IS THE ONLY MUTATION IN THE WHOLE WORKFLOW. Listing openings, drawing a
 * rim, running the engine, drawing a patch, cancelling and discarding all leave
 * the resident document byte-identical and its revision exactly where it was.
 *
 * AND APPLY IS OBSERVABLY ATOMIC — Stage 4B-1B2-R2. Every fallible piece of the
 * answer is built BEFORE the authoritative swap, so a caller can never be told a
 * fill failed after it succeeded. See `createHoleFillCommitHandler`.

/* --------------------------------------------------- boundary preview -- */

/**
 * Draws one boundary component as line segments.
 *
 * RE-EXTRACTED RATHER THAN CACHED. The loops for a revision are deterministic
 * and cheap relative to holding a second copy of every rim in the worker, and a
 * cache would be one more thing that can describe geometry it no longer
 * matches. The identity the caller names has to resolve against the CURRENT
 * geometry or the request is refused — which is precisely the check a cache
 * would have let us skip.
 *
 * PART-LOCAL COORDINATES. The placement is applied by the viewport to the
 * object that holds this, never baked in here: a rim drawn at the document
 * origin for a part placed elsewhere marks an opening where the opening is not.

/**
 * Applies ONE stored, validated candidate. THE ONLY HOLE-FILL MUTATION.

 * THE TRANSACTION, in order, and the order is the point:
 *
 *   1. resolve the document the caller named;
 *   2. `prepareCommit` applies every identity, lifecycle and staleness guard
 *      and returns the candidate's mesh — or a typed refusal, in which case
 *      nothing below runs;
 *   3. `assertMeshStructure` — rule 11. The candidate was validated when it was
 *      built, but a mesh is checked before it is accepted, every time;
 *   4. `withPartMesh` builds the SUCCESSOR document, sharing every other part by
 *      reference, and `assertGeometryDocument` checks what only a document can
 *      be asked;
 *   5. EVERY FALLIBLE PIECE OF THE ANSWER IS BUILT — the render snapshot, the
 *      part descriptors, the totals, the undo record's contents. See below;
 *   6. `residentDocuments.replace` re-checks the revision and swaps ONE map
 *      entry. That single swap is the atomic step: before it the user has the
 *      old document, after it the new one, and there is no moment in between
 *      where the revision has moved but the part has not;
 *   7. the candidate is consumed and the undo record written — both bounded map
 *      writes — and the already-built answer is returned.
 *
 * WHY THE ANSWER IS BUILT BEFORE THE SWAP — Stage 4B-1B2-R2, and this is the
 * whole point of the ordering.
 *
 * `buildRenderSnapshot` allocates: for a 250,000-face part it copies megabytes
 * and derives per-vertex normals. It can fail. When it ran AFTER the swap, its
 * failure threw out of the handler, the worker host turned that into an ordinary
 * error reply, and the caller was told the fill had FAILED — while the
 * authoritative document had already changed. "The worker's internal state was
 * consistent" is not the guarantee that matters: the guarantee that matters is
 * what the caller may observe, and observing a failure for a change that
 * happened is a lie the interface would then act on.
 *
 * So everything that can fail happens first, against the PROPOSED document, and
 * the swap is the last thing that can go either way. If it refuses — because the
 * revision moved while the answer was being built — the prepared snapshot is
 * discarded and nothing has changed. Preparing early cannot introduce a stale
 * race, because `replace` compares the revision itself and is the only arbiter.
 *
 * PREPARING A SNAPSHOT DOES NOT MAKE IT AUTHORITATIVE. It is disposable render
 * data derived from a document that does not exist yet; only the store's
 * replacement defines the mutation, and a refused swap means the snapshot
 * described something that never happened.
 *
 * A REFUSAL AT ANY STEP LEAVES EVERYTHING AS IT WAS, and specifically leaves the
 * candidate RESOLVED and retryable. Consuming it before the swap succeeded
 * would destroy a validated fill because of a transient race.
 *
 * NO GEOMETRY ARRIVES FROM THE PAGE. The payload is four identifiers. The page
 * could not send a mesh if it wanted to — it has never held one.
