/**
 * Diagnostic overlays, built from the worker's BOUNDED sample buffers.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE. The worker already returned every coordinate needed to draw
 * these. Nothing here asks for canonical geometry again, and nothing here
 * recomputes topology — that would put whole-mesh work on the UI thread, which
 * is the one thing this project does not do.
 *
 * BATCHING. One `LineSegments` per edge category and one `Mesh` for degenerate
 * faces. An `Object3D` per edge would mean fifty thousand objects, fifty
 * thousand draw calls, and a scene graph the renderer walks every frame; a
 * single interleaved buffer per category is one draw call regardless of count.
 *
 * COORDINATES ARE NOT TOUCHED. Sample positions are model coordinates, and they
 * are uploaded exactly as the worker produced them. Display centring lives on
 * the parent group's transform — the same group the model mesh is in — so the
 * overlay and the surface stay registered through fit, orbit, zoom, pan, and
 * resize without anyone rewriting a coordinate.
