 * dependency — while the application is tested in jsdom.
 *
 * End-to-end tests live in `e2e/` and are run by Playwright, not Vitest.

         * `GEO::initialize()` again and trips Geogram's duplicate
         * attribute-registration assertion. Under Node and inside a real
         * browser worker — which is where this code actually runs — it works.
         *

         * downloads, loaded with `wasmBinary` because the Emscripten glue is
         * built for `web,worker` and fetches its `.wasm` relative to
         * `import.meta.url`.
